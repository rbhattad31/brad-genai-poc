Description: Brave the elements with confidence in the Columbia Bugaboo II Fleece Interchange Jacket that lets you enjoy your outdoor adventures even more with its 3-in-1 functionality. This jacket basically consists of two separate layers that can be worn as a standalone piece or zipped together to form one warm and cosy outfit. It all depends on what kind of protection you need from the elements. The outer shell is equipped with Omni-Tech waterproof/breathable seam sealed technology with adjustments at the cuff and hem for a more secured fit against the wet weather running your day. The shell also has zip pockets for safe keeping, a zip front with a storm flap, and a removable, adjustable storm hood that you can wear or remove as needed. It's hard to the beat the protection of this layer. The inner layer is insulated with Omni-Heat(R) thermal-reflective lining that does a great job at upping this jacket's cozy game. This breathable warming technology helps regulate your temperature with little silver dots that reflect and retain the warmth your body generates. An additional moisture-wicking property allows excess heat and moisture to escape so that you don't overheat yourself. It's great to have it on during those unbearable cold days. The internal fleece liner jacket also has a full-zip front, hand pockets, and a stand collar. So why pack three when you can pack one

Omni-Shade clothing protects you from damaging UV radiation by blocking the majority of the sun's harmful rays, so you can stay out longer. 

What really elevates this humble piece is the gusset detailing which gives you full room to move.

Description: Adding some rugged appeal to your everyday fit is the Deschutes River Cargo Pant made from a technical fabric but styled for comfort. With a masculine silhouette, the pants are slimmer and better tailored than the usual baggy cargo's.

Omni-Shade clothing protects you from damaging UV radiation by blocking the majority of the sun's harmful rays, so you can stay out longer. 

What really elevates this humble piece is the gusset detailing which gives you full room to move. 
Partial-elastic at the waist that helps adjust the fit and a sip-stop outer shell means they're built for anything. Let's not forget the many spacious pockets that help you carry essentials conveniently.

Description: The key to thriving in the chill is with the Delta Ridge Down Hooded Jacket  Using Columbia’s latest and patented technologies there is no compromises in warmth or features.  

When you are up in the mountains there is a difference between being okay and being warm, that is when the power of the advanced Omni Heat Reflective Technology comes into play by reflecting and retaining body heat, no matter how cold a climate you encounter. Its thermal reflective lining reflects your body heat for warmth while maintaining a high level of breathability. Strategically filled with 650 fill power, the responsibly sourced insulation offers excellent warmth to weight ratio.  This combination works extremely well for both dynamic winter activities as well as for casual in-town warmth.  

Worried with performance in wet weather? There is an update  Apart from having a unique water resistant construction, the jacket has a heat seal construction. This means that a high tech thermal bonding creates stitch free chambers of down. Compared to traditional construction, heat seal provides improved heat retention and reduced down migration and water penetration so you stay warmer and drier. 

What makes it impressive is that its features - well fitting scuba hood, chin guard, and zippered hand pockets for plenty of storage; add function but not weight
