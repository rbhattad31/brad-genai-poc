About Tamani Arts Offices:

Tamani Arts Offices is a freehold business tower in the district that lies just a few metres away from the creek’s coastline. It stands prominently in the two million sq. ft. large mixed-used area known as the Artisan Cluster. The architecture involves a high-rise complex with three sleek rectangular buildings that meet each other perpendicularly on top of a large three-storey podium. The 16-floor high structure features a reflective glass facade, while the podium showcases black and white decorative motifs. This unique design concept was conceived by the Britain-based architects known as Terry Farrell & Partners. Location-wise it is strategically built along Al Asayel Street which connects it to Financial Centre Road."

Jumeirah is a coastal residential area of Dubai, United Arab Emirates mainly comprising low rise private dwellings and hotel developments. It has both expensive and large detached properties as well as more modest town houses built in a variety of architectural styles. The area is popular with expatriates working in the emirate and is familiar to many tourists visiting Dubai.

Archaeological excavations at Jumeirah Archaeological Site, which was discovered in 1969, demonstrate that the area was inhabited as far back as the Abbasid era, approximately in the 10th century CE. Measuring about 80,000 m2 (860,000 sq ft), the site lay along a caravan route linking India and China to Oman and Iraq."
